In this assignment, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) dataset to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This challenge will be broken down into three points where you will create an interactive visual graph.

## Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

- Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
- Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
- Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

## Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

- Use otu_ids for the x values.
- Use sample_values for the y values.
- Use sample_values for the marker size.
- Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
- Use otu_labels for the text values.

## Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

- Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

The final result should look something like the below image:
